# Known Vulnerabilities

This page contains a list of all known vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of `JDBC connector for Apache Kafka`.

## CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-44228 a.k.a. Log4Shell

The [CVE-2021-45046](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45046) and [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228) vulnerabilities affect the `Apache Log4j` logging library in versions prior 2.15.0.

`JDBC connector for Apache Kafka` does not use any version of [`Log4j`](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) directly as it uses [`slf4j`](http://www.slf4j.org/log4shell.html), which acts as an abstraction layer over logging frameworks. For this reason, **this project is not directly impacted by said vulnerabilities**.

We recommend all users of `JDBC connector for Apache Kafka` to inspect their dependency tree and make sure they are not including any impacted version of `Log4j`. In case `Log4j` is used, we highly encourage to update to a newer version where these vulnerabilities are addressed (`2.16.0` or newer at the time of this writing).
