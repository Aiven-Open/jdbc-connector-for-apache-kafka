# Aiven's JDBC Sink and Source Connectors for Apache KafkaÂ®

This repository includes a Source connector that allows transfering data from a relational database into Apache Kafka topics
and a Sink connector that allows to transfer data from Kafka topics into a relational database
[Apache Kafka Connect](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect) over JDBC.

The project originates from Confluent
[kafka-connect-jdbc](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-jdbc).
The code was forked before the change of the project's license. We want
to thank the Confluent team for their efforts in developing the
connector and aim to continue keeping this fork well-maintained and
truly open.
