kafka-connect-jdbc is a [Kafka Connector](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect)
for loading data to and from any JDBC-compatible database.

Documentation for this connector can be found [here](http://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/connect-jdbc/docs/index.html).

# Development

To build a development version you'll need a recent version of Kafka as well as a set of upstream Confluent projects, which you'll have to build from their appropriate snapshot branch. See the [FAQ](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-jdbc/wiki/FAQ)
for guidance on this process.

You can build kafka-connect-jdbc with Maven using the standard lifecycle phases.
