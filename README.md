# Kafka Connect JDBC Connector

This repository includes a Sink and Source
[Kafka Connect](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect)
connectors for JDBC-compatible databases.

The project originates from Confluent
[kafka-connect-jdbc](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-jdbc).
The code was forked before the change of the project's license. We want
to thank the Confluent team for their efforts in developing the
connector and aim to continue keeping this fork well-maintained and
truly open.
